# Data & Scope

For this workshop, we offer a certain set of data from the NWA collection.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Indexed collections
Currently, we have indexed three selected collections to SolrWayback. The indexed data is ≈9TB, which corresponds to 0.45% of the total collection.[^1]

The follow collections have been indexed:

|--- | --- | --- | --: | --: |
|**Collection**|**Period**|**Description**|**Number of objects**|**Data size**|
|`noall`|2019-22|Domain crawls of .no|96 233 797|7.5TB|
|`samisk`|2020-22|Sámi websites|1 306 577|68GB|
|`valg2001`|2001|Political parties from the 2001 Parliamentary Election|87 782|1.6GB|


TIP: To see all resources in a collection, you can search in SolrWayback for `collection:{collection_name}`. For example, `collection:noall` will return all resources in the `noall` collection.
