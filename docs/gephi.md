# Gephi
Gephi allow you to visualise networks, such as domain clusters and relations between domains.

Gephi is an open-source software for network exploration and visualisation.[^1] It has been used in a number of projects, both inside and outside of adademia, e.g. in studies of Twitter network traffic during the terror attacks in Norway, 22 July 2011.[^2]

Before you start, you will need to export data from SolrWayback. To learn more about exporting data from SolWayback to Gephi, see [Link graph Gephi export](./solrwayback/features#link-graph-gephi-export)

## Open Gephi
From the virtual desktop, double-click the Gephi icon.

## Import data from SolrWayback
Go to "File" -> "Open".

Select the .csv file you exported from SolrWayback, and click "Next" -> "Finished" -> "Ok"

## Overview tab
In the "Overview" tab in the top right corner, check the number of #nodes.

If there more than 10.000 nodes, consider to make a new export from SolrWayback with a more fine-tuned query.
Alternatively, open the "Filter" tab (right), choose "Topology", and drag "Giant component" down to filters. Click "â–¸ Filter".

*The number of nodes are shown in the top right corner.*

*The "Giant component" filter can be dragged down to the filters.*

*Click "â–¸ Filter" to apply the filter.*

## Select layout
In the "Layout" tab on the left, choose "Yifan Hu" as your layout.

Then click "â–¸ Run" and wait.

Click "Run" until you are happy with how the visual distribution of the nodes.

(For graphs with 1 million nodes, this can take hours. So you are strongly encouraged to scope down the amount of nodes, during this workshop!)

## Statistics
In the "Statistics" tab, find "Network diameter" and press "Run".

Then, find "Modularity" and press "Run".

## Define Appearance
In the "Appearance" tab, click "Nodes".

Click the color palette icon (ðŸŽ¨). Choose "Partition", and then as "Attribute" you choose "Modularity class".

Click "â–¸ Apply"

## Adjust text
Still in the "Appearance" tab, click label size (tT).

Then, press ranking, an as attribute you choose "Betweeness centrality".

## Preview
To preview the network graph, go to "Preview" mode.

Down to the left, press "ðŸ”„ Refresh".

## Export graph
To export the graph, click "File > Export > SVG/PDF/PNG file".

Choose the desired format, and click "Export".
