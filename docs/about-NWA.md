Simply put, NWA collect the Norwegian part of the internet. More precisely, that means content published on the Norwegian top-level domain (.no), content published by Norwegians or content in the Norwegian language.

The collection is maintained by the National Library of Norway, and available for research purposes.

## The NWA collection
The National Library of Norway (NLN) has experimented with web archiving since 1999, when we archived the Municipal and County Council elections.

Since 2005, we have harvested the Norwegian web on a regular basis, with three different approaches:
- Domain crawls
    - Broad crawls of the Norwegian top-level domain (.no)
- Thematic crawls
    - Selected topics (news, blogs, gaming, SÃ¡mi, queer, etc.)
- Event crawls
    - Planned or unplanned events (elections, terror attacks, cultural events, pandemics, etc.)
