# Workshop on the Norwegian Web Archive
These pages contain user documentation for research services in development at the National Library of Norway's Web Archive (NLNWA). The aim is to provide documentation with how-to-guides and explanation of the different services, enabling researchers to understand and make use of the different tools and services.

For more information, see the [Documentation for NLNWA's research services](https://nlnwa.github.io/research-services)

# Credits
The pages are built with [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/), a responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-theme for documentation with built-in search.
